    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Muhammed Hasan and I am currently enrolled in a Software Development Bootcamp provided by Just IT. I aspire to become a proficient software developer, equipped with both the skills and experience to implement cutting-edge solutions that positively impact businesses and communities. My overarching objective is to continually expand my knowledge and capabilities within my field as technology is a sector where its continuously improving and working in this sector means you must adapt to such situations.  </p>
    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>The rapid advancement of technology and artificial intelligence, particularly in recent years, has captured my keen interest. The practical application of AI across various sectors, including education, underscores its transformative potential. As we continue to explore its capabilities, the seemingly limitless boundaries of AI remain to be fully explored.</p>
    <p>I am consistently seeking opportunities to enhance my expertise and diversify my skill set, particularly within the realm of programming. Independently, I have dedicated time to studying Java, C++, and HTML, and I am presently engaged in further refining my proficiency in these languages.</p>
    <h2>My skills</h2>
    <p>My career history has equipped me with many transferrable skills such as:</p>
        <p>•	Attention to detail has been honed through my experience at a law firm, where I meticulously reviewed extensive case files and synthesized key information into concise summaries. This skill was further refined in both retail and primary education sectors. I adeptly sourced alternative products, considering various factors such as pricing, dietary restrictions, and ingredients when faced with product unavailability. Additionally, in my role within a primary school setting, I worked with small groups of children assisting and proofreading all their work to feedback to the main teacher. </p>
        
       <p> •	Communication skills are essential within any team dynamic, as exemplified by my experiences across various roles. During my experience at a law firm, I had to work with my colleagues to inform them about completed files, deadlines and task progression. At Sainsburys, I consistently delivered exceptional customer service, actively listening to customers to swiftly and efficiently address their needs. This skill was further refined at my primary school role, where I was required to communicate with teachers across the school in many different situations. Notably, I effectively managed a situation involving a student injury in the playground, promptly coordinating with a first aid trained staff and assisting in documenting the incident for school records. </p>
